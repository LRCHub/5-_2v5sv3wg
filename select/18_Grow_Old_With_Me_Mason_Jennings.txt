I met an old man who was not quite an old man
He said he was an old boy
And I would make a toast to believe and bet you
That I would be the same old man
Not the kind with a lost soul who can't put down his toys
Honey there'll be absolute peace in my heart, resolution in my soul

So don't, don't, darlin' don't be surprised
When I don't leave your side
'Cause there's not a single part of my love
You should not believe
I hope when I grow old, that she'll grow old with me

And I begged the pardon of the [?] and somebodys
'Cause I like the left lane
And I begged the pardon of the mass media
Even on Sundays I don't go to mass
And I tipped my hat to your dog in your yard by your house
Waiting for a hurricane
To blow blow blow from the west to the east
And tell me, who's going to be here last?

So don't, don't, darlin' don't be surprised
When I don't leave your side
'Cause there's not a single part of my love
That you should not believe
I hope when I grow old, that she'll grow old with me
I hope when I grow old, that she'll grow old with me
I hope when I grow up, that she'll grow up with me

Thank you guys
